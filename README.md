Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Therefore, preventing heart-related disorders has become extremely important. Good data-driven prediction systems can support early diagnosis, improve treatment, and help more people live healthy lives.
This is where Machine Learning plays a crucial role. ML models can analyze medical parameters and make accurate predictions about whether a patient is likely to have heart disease.

In this project, I worked with a heart disease dataset and performed proper data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and feature selection. Multiple Machine Learning models were trained and evaluated to compare their performance, including both traditional and deep learning methods.

This work is based on the Kaggle kernel: Binary Classification with Sklearn and Keras.

I implemented a variety of classification algorithms in Python to predict the presence of heart disease. The input features consist of medical attributes such as age, cholesterol, resting blood pressure, chest pain type, maximum heart rate, etc. The target variable is binary, indicating whether heart disease is present or not.
